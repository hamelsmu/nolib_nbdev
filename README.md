nolib nbdev
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This repo shows a minimal example of how to create a documentation site
with the features of nbdev, without having to create a nbdev library.

### This is a companion to [this official tutorial](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/docs_only.html).

## How This Repo Was Created

This repo was created by using `nbdev_new`, and then following these
steps:

1.  Remove library files

``` bash
rm setup.py .github/workflows/test.yaml nbs/00_core.ipynb
```

2.  Remove your library folder (this will be the `lib_path` field in
    `settings.ini`):

``` bash
rm -rf <lib_path>
```

## How To Use

We can use this project like any nbdev project!

#### To test the docs:

``` bash
nbdev_test
```

#### To preview the docs:

``` bash
nbdev_preview
```
