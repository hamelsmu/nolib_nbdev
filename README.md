This repo shows a minimal example of how to create a documentation site
with the features of nbdev, without having to create a nbdev library.

## How This Repo Was Created

This repo was created by using `nbdev_new`, but then deleting `setup.py`
and the `lib_path` folder.

``` bash
nbdev_proc_nbs && cd _proc && quarto publish
```
